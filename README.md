# Hello world! 👋

I am a computer science student at the [University of Nottingham](https://cs.nott.ac.uk) on my second year! I am also a hobbyist programmer who loves his video games and a varied range of alternative music. Sharing knowledge to others is something I find very enjoyable, anybody can learn programming and I want to share my knowledge to those who want to learn! I have quite a few cool things on the p5js website >>[Here!](https://editor.p5js.org/Barnold__/sketches)<<.

**SIDE NOTE: this wont add up to 100% because I kept some irrelevant data out**
