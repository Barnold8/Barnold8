# Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student at the [University of Nottingham](https://cs.nott.ac.uk) on my third year! I am also a hobbyist programmer who loves his video games and a varied range of alternative music. Sharing knowledge to others is something I find very enjoyable, anybody can learn programming and I want to share my knowledge to those who want to learn! I have quite a few cool things on the p5js website >>[Here!](https://editor.p5js.org/Barnold__/sketches)<<. And if all of this information wasn't enough, I also have a personal [webpage](https://barnold8.github.io/index.html).
