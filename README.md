# Hello world! 👋

I am a compiter science student at the University Of Nottingham on my second year! I am also a hobbyist programmer who loves his video games and a varied range of alternative music. Sharing knowledge to others is something I find very enjoyable, anybody can learn programming and I want to share my knowledge to those who want to learn!
